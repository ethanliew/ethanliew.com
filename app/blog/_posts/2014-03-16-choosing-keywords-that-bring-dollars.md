Assess the demand for the keywords. How many people are looking for them? What is the demographics?

Will the traffic from the keywords help you achieve your goal? For example, you don't want to pay for a PPC keyphrase that is not converting.

Keywords that bring a lot of traffic don't necessarily bring in dollars.

What visitors are expecting to see when they click on your keyphrase? What is the user's intent? Make sure the landing page meets your customer's expectations.

What is the competition for those keywords? It can be hard and costly to compete against well-established sites for highly competitive keywords.
