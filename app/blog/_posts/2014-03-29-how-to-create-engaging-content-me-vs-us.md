## Definition

'Engaging content' is content that generates links, likes and shares.

## 3 step strategy

1. Research the topic people are interested in. Look at forums and question/answer sites. Find what **people** want to know.

1. Create **highly relevant** content on that topic. Make content about '**me**', content that will make '**my**' life better.

1. Find influencers online: popular bloggers, people with thousands of followers on Twitter.
Build personal relationships with those people and think about how you can make **them** look good by spreading your content. Give them content that they want to share, content that will help **their** audience. This way you will take advantage of existing network.

## Examples

### Bad. Low engagement

Content is all about **them** and how good **they** are: "**our** products", "**our** chefs", "**our** industries". Content is written very well but it will not generate many shares because it is not helpful to '**me**'.

### Good. High engagement

It is more user-centric. It is about '**me**'. It has "recipes", "videos", "articles" that are useful to '**me**' and improves '**my**' life. This is kind of content that gets shared with friends.

## Other tips

### Repurpose good content

If your blog post has many shares/likes take this topic and say the same thing through a different medium: infographic, video or a slide presentation. This way you can reach those people who consume information through **other** distribution channels.

Take popular content that **other** people created and repurpose it. **Give original author full credit.** Then reach out to the author: "We liked your article so much that we created a video based on it. Please consider sharing it with your audience."

### Track your conversions on GA

Measure conversions in Google Analytics. Setup goals to track your conversions:

* Sharing
