1. Post frequently and on regular basis.

1. Avoid constant self-promotion.

1. Improve the quality of your writing or hire a professional writer, journalist and an editor.

1. Be careful with guest posts on your blog. Write your own content.

1. Avoid stuffing your content with keywords. Keyword research is useful in choosing a **topic** for your post. But content should be natural and read well. Write for your audience, not for search.
