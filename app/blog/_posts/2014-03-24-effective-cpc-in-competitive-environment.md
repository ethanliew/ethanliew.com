## Have proper tracking in place

Track conversions for CPC keywords.

Make sure your Google Analytics is synced with AdWords.

Setup ecommerce tracking on Google analytics to see how much money is generated from those keywords and were they came from.

## Broad matching

Be careful with default 'broad matching' option. Your Ad may show when search turm contains variations of your keywords. For example "women's hats" may show for "buy ladies hats".

## close variations

Turn off close variations: 'Do not include close variants' checkbox in AdWords. Close variations are plurals, misspellings and other related words. Otherwise you will pay for different variations of you keywords that you can't control.

## Negative match

Have robust negative keyword list. Look at keyword details on your CPC campaign to see keywords that you are getting clicks for. You probably don't want to pay for words like 'free', 'how to', 'jobs' or 'diy'.

## Branding phrases

Add branding to phrases to get more targeted customers. For example, instead of 'toys' use 'Lego toys'. You will get people who already know the brand they want. Such visitors are more likely to buy.

## Pay more for mobile

Increase you 'bid modifier' for mobile if you want more mobile traffic and your site is optimised for that.

## Remarketing

Bring back customers through remarketing. It will allow you to show ads to people who already visited your site. Remarketing ads can be much cheaper and very effective because your are reaching back to your old customers.

## Managed placements

Use managed placements if you want to show your ads on certain sites where you think your customers may spend time.

## Intent keywords

Bid higher on keywords that show intent. For example, bid higher on 'buy dining table' keyphrase, as opposed to just 'dining table'.

## Beyond AdWords

Expand in other advertising channels that have your target clients: Bing, Facebook, LinkedIn etc.

## Relevant landing pages

Use custom landing pages that closely match you Ad text. You want the text on this landing page to be as close to your Ad as possible. Ideally identical.
