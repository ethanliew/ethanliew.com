![Relative popularity of Web, iOS and Android developers](/image/blog/2014-04-27-programming-trends-web-ios-android-developers.png)

## Description

This inforgaphic shows relative popularity of 'Web developer', 'iOS Developer' and 'Android Developer' keywords. Google Trends was used to get the data which was filtered by 'Programming' category. Time period: from 2009 till May 2014.

The term 'iOS' was introduced by Apple in June 2010 which replaced 'iPhone OS'. I used 'iPhone developer' for years 2009 and 2010 instead of 'iOS developer'.

Sofware used: infogr.am, Google Docs and Pixelmator.
