This is the third and final part of tutorial.

* In [the first part](/blog/testing-activity-in-android-studio-tutorial-part-1/) we learned how to create a new project, add a test configuration and run the tests.

* In [the second part](/blog/testing-activity-in-android-studio-tutorial-part-1/) we created our first test.

Now we will write all other tests and build the app.

### The Greeter app

Just to remind you, our app will have three components:

1. An **EditText** where user enters name.
1. A "Greet" **Button**.
1. And a **TextView** that will show the greeting message.
