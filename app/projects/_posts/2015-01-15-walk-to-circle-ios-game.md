I really like listening to an audio book/podcast/music while walking around the city with no purpose.

When I walk  very interesting things start happening. The audiobook's narrative gets imprinted in my head along with the memories of the places I walked in. Later when I recall a part of the audiobook it always brings pictures of the streets, houses and parks. I am not sure if it's the same for other people, but it appears that my brain stores visual and audio memories together. It is wonderful that I can later retrieve a geographical memory by recalling a part of the book.

My Walk to Circle iOS app makes the journeys more interesting. The game has three stages.

### 1. Drop a circle

First, it drops a circle randomly at a distance of about 400 meters from my current location. I have only 5 seconds to remember where the circle is before the map is closed.

### 2. Walk

Next, I walk to the circle. Yes, walk, physically, with my two legs.

### 3. Circle reached!

Finally, I receive a notification when the circle is reached.

I noticed that when I do not use the app I usually choose same roads and places. And that can get boring very quickly. I think it's like that because I unconsciously choose familiar and proven places in order to avoid risk. On the other hand, when I use the app it breaks my normal walking habits. The app suggests visiting new places and taking different paths. It chooses walking destination randomly which can lead to a very unique and different walking experience.

I hope you will enjoy the app. Please send me a message, I will be happy to hear what you think.
