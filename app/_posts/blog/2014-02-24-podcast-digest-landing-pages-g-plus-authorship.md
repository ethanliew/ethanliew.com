## Landing page

Make sure visitors can figure out what you are offering within 10 seconds after they land on your site. Or they will bounce.

Use CTA (call to action) and USP (unique selling proposition).

Look at your competitors' landing pages for best practices.

## "Thank you" page

When users reached your "thank you" page they are much easier to convert because they already showed some interest.

That's a great opportunity to upsale and engage through social media.

Make 'thank you' page a separate page so it can be tracked as a goal in Google Analytics.
