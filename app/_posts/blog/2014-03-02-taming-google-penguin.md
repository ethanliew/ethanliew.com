## What doesn't work

> Today only those who deserve 1st page ranking can get there.

Google Penguin update penalises those who artificially build backlinks.

Posting links to your site in comments on other sites will not help your SEO today.

Other forms of backlink manipulation are becoming less effective: guest blog posts and payed links on other sites.

## What works today

> What works is creating great content and promoting the hell out of it.

Create quality content and people will organically link to your pages from their web sites.

Your Google page rank depends on many factors, but number one ranking factor is page authority.

Google wants to show sites that are respected by people.

Page authority is about getting backlinks to your page from trusted sites.

## Strategy

1. Find good content
1. Improve that content
1. Outreach

## Step 1: Find good content

Look at your top competitors' content.

Find which content attracts most backlinks.

It can be done with following tools: ahrefs.com, majesticseo.com, opensiteexplorer.org.

## Step 2: Improve that content

> Take good content and make it great.

Improve the content in as many ways as you can: make it more detailed, informative, entertaining and up-to-date.

You need to create the best resource about your topic.

The goal is to create content that people will link to.

## Step 3: Outreach

> 90% of success depends on this step.

Find people who are influential in your space and let them know about your content.

Look for great resources online that will be willing to link to you and contact their creators with something like:

_"You linked to something similar. You have a page about this topic. Here is a great resource that I think you would like."_

Contact people **directly and personally**. Most effective way is email. It can also be done through social media.
