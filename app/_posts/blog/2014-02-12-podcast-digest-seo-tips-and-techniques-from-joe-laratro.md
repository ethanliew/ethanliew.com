Research your keywords using [spyfu.com](http://www.spyfu.com/) and [Google Trends](http://www.google.com.au/trends/).

Make a list of your keywords.

Create a long-term SEO strategy. For example: "write 2 articles per week for a year".

Each article should be dedicated to a chosen keyword.

Do not just add keywords to old articles, write new articles.

Think of how people will search with your keywords?

Develop content using natural language.

It is the combinations of keywords that matter because people search in many different ways.

People are now searching with:

* longer search queries
* queries in form of questions
* natural language
* voice search on phones
