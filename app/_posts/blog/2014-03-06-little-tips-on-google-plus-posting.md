Write an article on your website and then post a link to it on Google Plus. Post a big picture and some intro text as well.

Use hash tags in the text to make it more searchable on G+.

Statistics is important. But don't spend too much time on it. It can be misleading and can distract you from doing things that matter.

Having a complete G+ profile with a nice picture is very important to your success.

## 80% - 20% rule

80% of your G+ posts can contain links to content from other people. 20% will link to the content that you created.
