## Mobile stats (as of Jan 2014)

31% of Americans access the Internet ONLY from a mobile device

Almost 70% of all Facebook usage is mobile.

90% of all links shared on Twitter come from mobile phone.

48% of all email is opened from mobile phone.

## Email marketing

You email sender name is the largest text in the inbox. Take advantage of it.

Email subject line may get truncated on small screens. Therefore first 5 or 6 words are most important.

Time of the day when emails are sent is the key because it determines if/when those emails are read. Investigate the best time of the day to maximize conversion.

Make email text big. Use responsive email templates.

## SMS marketing

Consider using text messaging marketing. For example, at live events you can say to your visitors: "Text GIFT to 555333 to get a discount" and send back a link.
