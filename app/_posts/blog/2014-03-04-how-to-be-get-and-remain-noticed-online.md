When creating your content don't try to please everybody.

Avoid being generic. Try to be specific.

In order to get though the noise and be noticed you it must create something peculiar.

Develop your own style. It may be edgy or weird but must stand out from the crowd.

'Good content' is everywhere, but what people really like is **personality**. We want to make emotional connection with the author.

Your style is just as important as substance.

Example of very successful branding strategy is Lady Gaga. She developed her own unique branding: clothes, paw greeting, calling her fans 'little monsters'.
