This is an online store for a film transfer company. Developed with ASP.NET MVC and jQuery technologies. The most challenging part of the job was to develop an order page in JavaScript to provide seamless single-page user experience. A custom content management system was developed for the web site. The store is integrated with Authorize.net and PayPal payment gateways and UPS shipping service.
