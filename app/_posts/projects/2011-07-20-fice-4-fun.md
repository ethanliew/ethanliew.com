This is a simple board game I wrote in order to practice JavaScript and learn jQuery and HTML DOM manipulation. In this game the playing pieces are moved according to the roll of dice. The game is played against one, two or tree computer opponents.

<script src="/js/javascript-game.js"></script>
<script>
  diceGameEvg.init();
</script>
