# Hello

My name is Evgenii Neumerzhitckii. I am a software developer.

I make web sites and apps for smartphones, tablets, desktops and boomerangs (just kidding).

I am working with HTML, JavaScript and Ruby professionally. And on my free time I am currently learning iOS and Android app development.

Read my [blog](/blog), [projects](/projects) or view [my resume](/resume).
