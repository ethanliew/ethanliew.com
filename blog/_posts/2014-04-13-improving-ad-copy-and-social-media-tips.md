## How to improve your Ad copy

* Focus on your benefits.
* Address objections on landing page.
* A/B test your Ad and landing page.
* Speak the language of your audience.
* Incorporate 'power words': you, new, free, instantly.
* Improve your offer to increase conversion.


## Social media tips

* Use social platforms differently. Twitter post is not suitable for Facebook.
* Use Instagram if you need access to young audience.
* Post at right time of the day/week. It is ok to post the same twit more than once.
* Have a bio on every social media account.
* Social is a two-way street. Respond, share other links, retweet.
* Proofread.
* Be brief.
