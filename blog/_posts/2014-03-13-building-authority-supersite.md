## Headlines and content

Use FAQ-type headlines. Real headlines work better than spammy ones with lots of keywords.

There is a big reward for having natural content.

Release your content more frequently. Goal is to create thousands of pages.

Images are important for image search results.

## Long term strategy

Develop a brand to get people searching for that brand.

Don't worry about keyword research or backlink building.

Spammy backlinks and thin sites with no value are not going to work in the long term.

Spread the word about your content. Communicate with people in forums and on Facebook.
