It is not a secret that all seven Harry Potter novels are my favorite books and I became very excited when I discovered that there would be a new addition to the series in form of a stage play and its script publication. After I recovered from the pleasant shock a simple natural question was born in my head. Is the Cursed Child the official part of Harry Potter universe or is it a fan fiction?

I ask this question because information coming from J.K. Rowling and pottermore.com so far is unclear. Moreover, I can be wrong but this information feels a bit misleading. In order to avoid misinterpretation, bias and being compared to Rita Skeeter I would try to keep this post as factual as possible and use official sources.

### What the official sources say about the Cursed Child story?

The current (not final) cover of the script book says:

> Based on an *original new story* by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne, John Tiffany.

A post on pottermore.com titled "New details on Cursed Child, the ‘eighth Harry Potter story’" has the following subtitle:

> ‘Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' is *the official eighth Potter story* and the first to be presented on stage.

This article continues with the folling sentence:

> Written by Jack Thorne and directed by Olivier and Tony award-winner John Tiffany, the play is a brand new story *written in collaboration with J.K. Rowling*.

Another post from pottermore.com titled “Cursed Child director John Tiffany and writer Jack Thorne talk to the PMC about their creative collaboration with J.K. Rowling.” shares the following details:

> The three of them (J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany) *set the plot* that day in J.K. Rowling’s writing room. They strung together the narrative then and there in notebooks and then Jack and John flew back to London to get started.


### Tweets from J.K. Rowling about Cursed Child

Here are some tweets related to the Cursed Child story posted under @jk_rowling account.

> This story is almost correct, except that *I haven't written the script* for #CursedChild, @jackthorne has.

>  #CursedChild is a play and while *we have worked very closely on it*, the wonderful writer is @jackthorne

> Due to the epic nature of the story *we’ve been working on*, Harry Potter & the #CursedChild will be in two parts! @HPPlayLDN

> The story of #CursedChild *should be considered canon*, though. @jackthorne, John Tiffany (the director) and I developed it together.

> It will tell a new story, which is the result of a *collaboration* between writer Jack Thorne, director John Tiffany and myself.

### My conclusion

I think I can make the following conclusions based on the information from the official sources.

1. Firstly, as J.K. Rowling said multiple times, that she *worked* on the Cursed Child story with Jack Thorne and John Tiffany.
1. Secondly, the blog post on pottermore.com says that three of them *discussed* the plot of the story.
1. Thirdly, and more importantly, J.K. Rowling explicitly stated that she did not write the story.
1. On the other hand J.K Rowling made it clear that the Cursed Child is *canon*, which means that it is the official story in the Harry Potter universe and not a fan fiction.
1. And finally, pottermore.com repeats the last point by calling Cursed Child “the official eighth Potter story”.

This is where I get confused and I will be happy if anyone can solve this mystery for me. How can the Cursed Child be official eighth Potter story if J.K. Rowling did not actually write it?
