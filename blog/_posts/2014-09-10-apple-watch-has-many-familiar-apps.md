Today I watched the introduction of the Apple Watch. Some apps on this device are truly amazing. There was a miniature working model of the Solar System that shows current positions of the planets. There are apps that open hotel doors and let you feel your friend's heartbeat remotely. There is even an app that helps you navigate through the city streets using only the sense of touch.

There was one app missing - the Web browser.
