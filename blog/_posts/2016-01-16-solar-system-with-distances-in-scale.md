To understand the magnitude of the Solar System it is helful to look at it in scale. In the [previous post](/blog/sun-and-planet-sizes-in-scale/) I ilustrated the relative *sizes* of the Solar System objects. Today my focus was to draw the *distances* between them. Figure 1 shows a zoomed out picture of the part of Solar System that humans expolored so far. The most distant region shown in this picture is the heliopause. This is where the motion of the Sun's solar wind stops relative to the flow of interstellar particles. In 2012 Voyager 1 space probe reached this region at the speed of 17 km/s and entered interstellar space. The journey took thirty five years since the probe's launch in 1977.

The influence of the Solar System does not end here. It is hypothesized that there is a region called the *Oort cloud* between 50,000 au (0.8 light years) and 100,000 au (1.6 light years) from the Sun. It is believed that this region is filled with comets that are occasinally directed towards the inner Solar System.
