After beginning my morning walk I’m constantly scouring my surroundings, seeking out those things that motivate and excite me. Sound is a clear motivator for me, so I either have my podcast or my audio book playing when venturing out for a rejuvenating walk.  Everyone has that certain something they use when walking.

So, oddly enough, the audiobook, or music I choose to listen to ingrains the places where I’ve walked into my mind, so it is far easier to recall a part of the audio (or part of a song).  I’m also able to create a mental image within my mind of the places visited when out on an adventurous walk, places such as the streets and the houses and parks I’ve seen along my journeys.  These are all there, like collective puzzle pieces.

I’m not sure if this works the same for everyone, but for me, audio and visual stimuli come together perfectly when I’m walking.  I love the fact that I have the ability to retrieve a geographical memory just by recalling what I was listening to when I was walking to my location!

My Walk To Circle iOS App simply makes these journeys far more intriguing, and there are three stages to this process.

## 1. Drop a circle

First, when you start up the App it drops a circle randomly, at a distance of about 400 meters from whatever your current location might be. You then have approximately 5 seconds to memorize the placement of the circle on the map before it closes.

## 2. Walk

Now, all that is required is simply putting one foot in front of the other one and taking those steps!

## 3. Circle reached!

Finally, a notification is received once you reach that circle.

I’ve noticed that without using this app, I seem to almost always choose roads I’m familiar with, but then that takes all the fun out of a walk.  It actually removes any risks to my health or my life, but then, at the same time, it takes away the exploration of my environment too.  In fact, this gets down right boring, which is the entire reason I designed an application that would encourage structured, yet exciting walks.  This helps me to avoid choosing those paths I feel most comfortable with and it helps me become more of a traveller rather than someone who sticks to the straight and narrow.

I do hope you’ll enjoy my app and if you have any questions at all don’t hesitate to drop me a message.  I’ll be more than happy to offer advice and I’d love to hear what you think!
